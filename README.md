Lists the actions the Trump administration has made since taking office. Actions include such policy changes and orders to government agencies.

As important as they are, it excludes Trump statements that are not actions.

I would love your help!

For now, the only way you can add a Trump deed to this is if you are familiar with GitHub and YAML. The steps are:

- Fork this repo.
- Edit [deeds.yaml](https://github.com/jimkang/what-has-he-done/blob/gh-pages/data/deeds.yaml) in your fork.
- Add an entry to the file. An entry looks like this:

    -
      name: Trump forces out Border Patrol chief
      stamp: 2017-01-26
      description: >
        <blockquote>Border Patrol Chief Mark Morgan said he was asked to leave and decided to resign rather than fight the request, according to a U.S. official with knowledge of the brief video conference in which Morgan informed senior agents of the change.</blockquote>
      urls:
        -
          name: Official: Border Patrol chief tells agents he was forced out
          url: http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/ct-border-patrol-chief-exits-20170126-story.html
      tags:
      - dismantling
      - destablization

The name, stamp, and at least one url is required. Everything else is optional.

- After your edits, make sure the file validates in [YAML Lint](http://www.yamllint.com/).
- Make a pull request back to this repo.
- I'll then review and merge it if it looks good.

There is a [web app](http://jimkang.com/what-has-he-done/add-deed/) for submitting deeds in the works, but it's not ready yet.

**Development**

[Open issues are here.](https://github.com/jimkang/what-has-he-done/issues)

Structure
------

There's two apps here:

1. [The presenter app](http://jimkang.com/what-has-he-done/).
2. [The submission app](http://jimkang.com/what-has-he-done/add-deed/), which is for submitting deeds to be added.

**Presenter app**

`index.html` contains the static content in the app, which is mostly just text and a `<section>` tag. It's the first thing the browser loads. It then loads `index.js`.

`index.js`, in production, is a single JavaScript file containing all of the application logic.

It is built from several modules, each with its own job. [Browserify](http://browserify.org/). Browserify stitches them into a single index.js for easy consumption by the browser.

Modules are units of code that have their own scope. They can export functions or objects or values out of their scope. e.g.:

    const heyString = 'hey';

    function sayHey() {
      console.log(heyString);
    }

    module.exports = sayHey;

In the above module `heyString` is not available outside of the module, but `sayHey` is.

Modules reference each other with `require`. e.g.:

    var sayHey = require('./say-hey');
    var request = require('basic-browser-request');

    function sayHeyIfGoogleIsUp() {
      var reqOpts = {
        url: 'https://google.com',
        method: 'GET'
      };
      request(reqOpts, decideOnResponse);
    }

    function decideOnResponse(error, response, body) {
      if (error) {
        console.error(error);
      }
      else if (response.statusCode === 200) {
        sayHey();
      }
      else {
        console.log(`Got status code ${response.statusCode} for google.com.`);
      }
    }

    module.exports = sayHeyIfGoogleIsUp;

Here, the function exported by the `say-hey` module is stored in the variable `sayHey`. Similarly, the function exported by the `basic-browser-request` module is stored in `request`. The argument to `require` to pull in `say-hey` starts with a `.`. This indicates that it's a file path, and the module is to be found on the local file system. When a `require` argument does not start with a `.`, that indicates that it's an external Node module has been installed from [NPM](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/what-is-npm).

In the case of this app, the root module is defined in `app.js`. It has an [IIFE](http://benalman.com/news/2010/11/immediately-invoked-function-expression/) named `go` that kicks everything off. You can think of it like `main()` in a C program. Right now, all it does is call `route`.

`route` parses the URL hash (which it expects to be key-value pairs, like '#dataURL=http://something.com/data.yaml&what=something') into a dictionary that tells the app what to present. It looks for a `dataURL` param. If it finds that, it will use data from that URL. (In the future, things may not be this flexible.) If it does not find that parameter, it defaults to `data/deeds.yaml`.

Then, it asks the [list-em-all module](https://github.com/jimkang/list-em-all) to load that data. If the load is successful, `updateAllThings` sorts the loaded deeds, then asks `renderCurrentRoute` to filter the deeds by tags specified in the route, then calls list-em-all to render them.

Development setup
------------

First, install Node. Then:

    npm install
    npm install wzrd -g

Run it with:

    make run

Then, wzrd will say something like:

    wzrd index.js
    server started at http://localhost:9966

You can open your browser to that.

Run `make lint` and before committing.

Tests
-----

Run tests with `make test`.
